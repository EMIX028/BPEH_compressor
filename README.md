# BPEH_compressor
Little C project of making a compression system, using BPE and Huffman encoding. I used this to learn the language C.

# Byte Pair encoding (BPE)
This is an encoding used by Tokenizer and I want to use it here for the first step of data compressing.

# Huffman algorithm
The goal of an Huffman algorithm here is to combine it with BPE to make a binary tree to reduce the size again.
